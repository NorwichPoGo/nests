## Pokemon Go Norwich
Welcome to Pokemon Go Norwich - the unofficial companion site for Pokemon Go in Norwich, UK.

### Purpose
This site has been put together to help Pokemon Go trainers based in and around Norwich to learn more about the game.

Trainers can use the site to plan routes around the city, to decide the best spots for Community Days, and to discover local nests.


### Map
The map overview helps trainers to explore the world around them. It includes:

 - Pokestops and Gyms around Norwich
 - Potential EX-raid gyms
 - A search bar to find Pokestops/Gyms quickly

It also has a couple of useful tools for trainers who are working to add new Pokestops/Gyms to the game:

 - Portal data
 - Parks (for determining EX-eligibility)

New Portals are now being added to the game frequently, so to keep the map up-to-date you can use the update options in the labels attached to each feature.


### Nests
The nests page provides a quick overview of the nests around Norwich.

Trainers can report their local nests, or use the search bar to quickly find a nest.
