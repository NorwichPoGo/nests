<h4>This privacy notice aims to inform you about how we collect and process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you ("personal information") and information that could not. In the context of the law and this notice, "process" means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information. It tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.</h4>
<h4>We are committed to protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information. Our policy is not just an exercise in complying with the law, but a continuation of our respect for you and your personal information.</h4>
<h4>We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate.</h4>
<h4>Our policy complies with UK law accordingly implemented, including that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</h4>
<h4>The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regards to the processing and control of your personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the information provided at <a href="http://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org" target="_blank">http://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org</a>.</h4>
<h4>Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through our website.</h4>

<h3 id="1-data-protection-officer">1. Data Protection Officer</h3>

<h4>For example, we may aggregate profile data to assess interest in a product or service.</h4>
<h4>However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal information so that it can identify you in any way, we treat the combined data as personal information and it will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.</h4>

<h4>You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at <a href="mailto:dpo.pokemongonorwich@gmail.com">dpo.pokemongonorwich@gmail.com</a>. However, if you do so, you may not be able to use our website or our services further.</h4>
